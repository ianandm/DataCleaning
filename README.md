DataCleaning
============

The objective of this code is to generate a tidy data set from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset. The data set generated from this exercise will bring in data from multiple data sets in a way that its easier to analyze and understand. Further analysis will be possible with greater ease on this data set. The mergeDataSet function merges the data set given as a part of UCI HAR Dataset into one data set. This function also makes the column names of activity and subject descriptive.
