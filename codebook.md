Code explanation
------------------

Function - mergeDataSet()
1. read all the train and test data sets into data table variables dt1 to dt6
2. Get the test and train data sets (dt2 and dt5) populated only with the columns that have measurements of mean and std. The column names will read v1 to v70. I have taken the 17 variables mentioned in feature_info.txt which apparantly were used to estimate the feature vector for each pattern
3. Make the column names of the subject and activity data sets readable by assigning them nice and understandable names
4. Change the activity codes to descriptive activity names
5. call getTidyData(finDat) with the dataset generated by rbinding the 6 data sets (d11 to dt6)
6.
