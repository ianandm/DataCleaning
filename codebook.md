mergeDataSet()
1. read all the train and test data sets into data table variables dt1 to dt6
2. Get the test and train data sets (dt2 and dt5) populated only with the columns that have measurements of mean and std. The column
names will read v1 to v70. I have taken the 17 variables mentioned in feature_info.txt which apparantly were used to estimate the
feature vector for each pattern
